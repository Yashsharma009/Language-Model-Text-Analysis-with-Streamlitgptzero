Language Model Text Analysis with Streamlit

```plaintext


This Streamlit app allows users to analyze text using a simple unigram language model. It calculates perplexity, burstiness score, and provides an indication of whether the text is likely generated by a language model. Additionally, it includes visualizations for the most common words and repeated words in the input text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required packages installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit nltk matplotlib
```

### Running the App

Run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run your_app_name.py
```

Replace `your_app_name.py` with the name of your Python script.

## Usage

1. Enter the text you want to analyze in the provided text area.
2. Click the "Analyze" button to perform the text analysis.

## Dependencies

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Analysis Features

- **Perplexity:** Measures the language model's ability to predict the input text.
- **Burstiness Score:** Quantifies the burstiness (variability) of word frequencies in the text.
- **Text Analysis Result:** Indicates whether the text is likely generated by a language model.

## Visualizations

- **Most Common Words:** Bar chart showing the top 10 most common words in the input text.
- **Repeated Words:** Bar chart displaying the frequency of the top 10 repeated words in the input text.

## Acknowledgments

This app utilizes the following libraries:

- Streamlit
